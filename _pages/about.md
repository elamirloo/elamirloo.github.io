I'm currently a senior research scientist at Apple. I did most of my research in R&D labs in industry to follow my passion for bridging the gap between academia and industry & designing algorithms that solve real-world problems. You can find the results of my work in form of papers, patents and products. My research focuses on generative modeling, sequential decision making and computer vision.
