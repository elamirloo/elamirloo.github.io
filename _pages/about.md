I'm currently a senior research scientist at Apple. My passion is to design algorithms inspired by the-state-of-the-art and use them to solve the real-world problems and that's the reason that I chose to do most of my research in R&D labs in industry. You can find the results of my work in form of papers, patents and products. My research focuses on generative modeling, sequential decision making, computer vision and machine learning.
